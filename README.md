- ATtiny 45 (8 pin)
- ATtiny 85 (8 pin)
- ATtiny 24 (14 pin)
- ATtiny 44 (14 pin)
- ATtiny 84 (14 pin)

Installation and usage
----------------------

Following the [installation guide](http://hlt.media.mit.edu/?p=1695) to install the core files and follow [this guide](http://hlt.media.mit.edu/?p=1706) to find out how to build the circuit.
