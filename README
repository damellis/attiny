By Scott Daniels (ProvideYourOwn.com)
Based on Arduino attiny support by David A. Mellis.

This package adds pinout files for most ATtiny variants as well as some board configurations.

Currently supported chips are:

8 pins: ATtiny13 w/modifications to wiring.c
8 pins: ATtiny45/85
14 pins: ATtiny44/84
20 pins: ATtiny87/167
20 pins: ATtiny2313/4313
20 pins: ATtiny261/461/861



Usage
-----
cd /path/to/my/sketchbook
mkdir hardware
cd hardware
git clone http://github.com/provideyourown/attiny

(Re)Launch the Arduino IDE. Support chips will be shown in the "Tools->Board" menu.
Choose the appropriate configuration.
Choose the ISP programmer used.
Upload your sketch.
