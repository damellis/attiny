Arduino for ATtiny
==================
By Sylvain Leroux <sylvain@chicoree.fr>
Based on Arduino attiny support by David A. Mellis.

This set of file add support for (some) ATtiny chip on
the Arduino platform.

Currently supported chips are:
- ATtiny45 (original work by David A. Mellis)
- ATtiny85 (original work by David A. Mellis)
- ATtiny44 (original work by David A. Mellis)
- ATtiny84 (original work by David A. Mellis)
- ATtiny2313 (by Sylvain Leroux)

Usage
-----
cd /path/to/my/sketchbook
mkdir hardware
cd hardware
git clone http://github.com/s-leroux/attiny -b Arduino1

Next time you launch the Arduino IDE, the supported chip will be added
to the ''tools > board'' menu. Upload you sketch using the appropriate
ISP programmer.
